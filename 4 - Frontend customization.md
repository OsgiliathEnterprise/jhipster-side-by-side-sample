# Frontend customization

## Rationale

The Jhipster frontend generates a frontend with default Jhipster CRUD functionality. However, you may want to customize the frontend to better suit your customer needs. This can include adding new features, modifying existing functionality, or changing the appearance of the application.

### Customization go to's

The first component which could be of interest is the app.routes.ts file. This file is the entry point for the application and contains the main logic for the application.
You can modify this file to override the home route that was generated by Jhipster. This is useful if you want to change the default home page of the application.
